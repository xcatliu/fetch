http://xcatliu.github.io/fetch/

This repository is a fork from [whatwg/fetch](https://github.com/whatwg/fetch).

Some resources from https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/, https://whatwg.org/ and https://resources.whatwg.org/ is not avaliable in some location (such as China). So I created this mirror site to help people whoever needs it to fetching the docs.

## Build

run `node ./build.js` to replace resources and copy `Overview.html` to `index.html`.
